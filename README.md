This repository contains code Supplementary Information for Anttila et al., 2024 (doi here post-publication).

All supplementary material, including text, tables, and two supplementary 1:24000 scale maps of the study area, are available within the /Supplementary_Information/ directory.

Code used to Bayesian subsidence curves, built off of the SubsidenceChron.jl framework of Zhang et al. (2023) are available within the /Bayesian_Subsidence/ directory. The McCoy_Subsidence_Bayesian.ipynb notebook contains backstripping and age-height calculations for the entirety of the Trout Creek Sequence, McCoy Creek Group, and overlying Paleozoic strata, while the McCoy_SHORT_Subsidence_Bayesian.ipynb notebook begins at the putative rift-drift transition (ca. 651 Ma), and includes depictions of the relationships between the backstripped post-rift-drift tectonic subsidence curve and theoretical McKenzie-style thermal subsidence curves. Note that both of these notebooks require a Julia kernel.

Code used to generate figure components is accessible in the Real_McCoy.ipynb notebook, in the root directory of this repository. Outputs of this notebook are stored in the /Output/ directory.
